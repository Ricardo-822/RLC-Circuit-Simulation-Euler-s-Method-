# RLC Circuit Simulation (Euler's Method)
This project aims to showcase how Euler's Method could be used to  numerically solve the differential equation of an RLC circuit.

## Acknowledgement
Euler's Method is not the most accurate or computationally efficient method of solving differential equaitons numerically. This is simply showing how Euler's Method and other numerical analysis methods could be applied to problems in Electrical Engineering.
